If a mask is given, this method updates only the regions indicated by the mask. You can use
either “1”, “L” or “RGBA” images (in the latter case, the alpha band is used as mask). 
Where the mask is 255, the given image is copied as is. Where the mask is 0,
the current value is preserved. Intermediate values will mix the two images together, 
including their alpha channels if they have them.
